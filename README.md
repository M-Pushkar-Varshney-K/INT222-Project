If the server_side.js and mongo.js not work(say "NO MODULES FIND" then install npm modules folder or only type "npm i express socket.io mongoose path bcrypt" then run the port again.
I don't know why but dependencies are present in my json file but somettims work and sometime not. But after run "npm i express socket.io mongoose path bcrypt" problem solved it work correctly.
